## Hot Topics Bug Fix - 5 Posts Per Community (20:00)
- **Issue**: Clien showing only 2-3 posts instead of 5
- **Root cause**: View count parsing failed on "10.1 k" format (thousands shorthand)
- **Fix**: Added regex parsing to convert "k" format to actual numbers
- **Additional fix**: Lowered threshold for Clien (100 views or 3 comments or 10 likes)
- **Changed**: Notification to use all_posts instead of new_posts (always show TOP 5)
- **Result**: All 4 communities now consistently show 5 posts each
- Git commit: cdd9a29
