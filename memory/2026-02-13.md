# 2026-02-13 Session

## Time
10:00 ~ 10:35 KST (ongoing)

## Main Topics

### 1. Smart Search System (85% Complete)
- Exa Neural Search: ✅ Fully working
- Dart API: 85% complete (XML parsing optimization needed)
- Smart Router: Automatic tool selection working

**Created Files**:
- `scripts/smart-search.sh` - Auto-routes queries to appropriate tool
- `scripts/exa-search.sh` - Exa neural search
- `scripts/dart-search.sh` - Dart Korean stock disclosure (in progress)

### 2. Google Workspace Migration Planning
**Current State** (Both companies):
- Communication: Jandi + KakaoTalk (inefficient)
- Email: eCount IMAP (Roturn) + POP3 (KoreaCryo) + Outlook
- Inventory: eCount ERP (이카운트)
- Documents: Local PC (no backup, hard to share)

**Target State**:
- Gmail (cloud, mobile-friendly)
- Google Drive (real-time collaboration, AI searchable)
- Google Chat/Meet (unified communication)
- AI integration with Wayne Manor

**Migration Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Email migration (KoreaCryo first, then Roturn)
- Phase 2: Document centralization (Drive structure planned)
- Phase 3: AI integration

**Key Decisions**:
- iCount ERP stays (only email moves to Gmail)
- KakaoTalk stays for external customers
- Google Chat for internal only
- Dual-receive period: 2 weeks

**Drive Structure**:
```
/공통/회사규정,공지사항,회의록
/Roturn/영업,기술설치,블로그
/KoreaCryo/영업,제품사진,웹사이트
```

## Next Actions
1. Complete Dart API (XML parsing optimization)
2. KoreaCryo email migration test (POP3 → Gmail)
3. Create Drive folder structure with permissions
4. First AI integration demo for employees

## Notes
- Chris at office, working on company efficiency improvements
- Goal: Improve employee productivity through better tools + AI
- Both companies' individual accounts already created in Google Workspace
- Email migration not yet started (waiting for strategy finalization)
