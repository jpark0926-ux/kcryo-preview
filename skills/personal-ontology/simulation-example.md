# Simulation Example: Weekly Planning

**Date**: 2026-02-13 (Monday)
**Context**: Multiple projects competing for limited time
**Question**: How should I allocate my week?

---

## Current State (from ontology.yml)

**Projects**:
- Project A: 🟡 waiting (photo blocker)
- Project B: 🟢 active (60% complete)
- Project C: 🟢 active (need decision)

**Blockers**:
- Project A: Missing product photos (2.5hr fix)
- Project B: None
- Project C: Logo decision needed (1hr)

**Energy**: Peak at 15:00-18:00

---

## Scenario A: Focus on Project B

**Time allocation**: 20h Project B, 5h others

**Predicted outcomes**:
- ✅ Project B completed (100%)
- ⚠️ Project A still blocked
- ⚠️ Project C delayed
- ⚠️ Next week still has 2 blockers

**Pros**:
- One project fully completed
- Clear win/progress

**Cons**:
- Blockers compound
- Other projects suffer
- Opportunity cost (if blockers were resolved, all projects move)

**Score**: 6/10
- Progress: 8/10
- Risk: 4/10 (high opportunity cost)
- Sustainability: 5/10

---

## Scenario B: Balanced Approach

**Time allocation**: 10h Project B, 10h others

**Predicted outcomes**:
- ✅ Project B 80% → progress but not done
- ⚠️ Project A still blocked
- ✅ Project C decision made

**Pros**:
- Steady progress across board
- Lower risk

**Cons**:
- Nothing completed
- Still 1 blocker remaining
- Spread thin

**Score**: 8/10
- Progress: 7/10
- Risk: 8/10 (balanced, safe)
- Sustainability: 9/10

---

## Scenario C: Clear Blockers First ⭐

**Time allocation**: 
- Monday 15:00-17:30 (peak): Clear both blockers (2.5h + 1h)
- Rest of week: Full focus on actual work

**Predicted outcomes**:
- ✅ All blockers cleared (0 blockers)
- ✅ Project A unblocked → can progress
- ✅ Project B continues smoothly
- ✅ Project C unblocked → can progress
- ✅ Week 2-5: No blocker drag, 3 projects moving

**Pros**:
- 3.5hr investment → unlock entire week
- All projects accelerate
- Compound effect (next weeks faster)
- Peak energy used for important work

**Cons**:
- Delayed gratification (Monday = prep, not progress)
- Requires discipline

**Score**: 9/10 ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- Progress: 9/10 (enables future progress)
- Risk: 9/10 (very low, removes obstacles)
- Sustainability: 10/10 (sets up smooth flow)

## Decision

**Choose**: Scenario C (Clear Blockers First)

**Action plan**:
1. **Monday 15:00** (energy peak): 
   - Take/edit product photos (2.5h)
   - Finalize logo decision (1h)
2. **Monday 18:30**: All blockers cleared ✅
3. **Tuesday-Friday**: 
   - Full focus on Project B (complete by Wed)
   - Project A work (Thurs-Fri)
   - Project C next steps

**Expected result**: 
- End of week: 0 blockers, 1 completed project, 2 advancing projects
- Next week: Clear runway for all

---

## Key Insight

**3.5 hours of blocker-clearing** (18% of week)  
→ **Unlocks 100% productivity** for remaining 82% + future weeks

**Compound effect**: Clearing obstacles early = week-long acceleration

---

## Tracking

- [ ] Monday 15:00: Execute blocker clearing
- [ ] Monday EOD: Update ontology.yml (blockers: 2 → 0)
- [ ] Friday: Review actual vs predicted outcome
- [ ] Next simulation: Use learnings to improve accuracy
